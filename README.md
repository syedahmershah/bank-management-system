# Bank Management System - C++

This **Bank Management System** is a simple **console-based** application developed using **C++** as part of my **first-semester final project** at university. The system provides basic banking functionalities such as creating accounts, making deposits and withdrawals, and checking balances. It uses **file handling** to store data persistently without relying on any external databases.

## Features

- **Account Management**: Create, update, delete, and view bank accounts.
- **Transactions**: Deposit, withdraw, and check the balance for each account.
- **Data Storage**: All account details are saved and retrieved using **file I/O** (no database used).

## How It Works

This system simulates a basic banking environment with the following key features:
1. **Account Creation**: Create a new bank account with a unique account number.
2. **Account Operations**: Deposit or withdraw money from an existing account.
3. **Balance Inquiry**: Check the balance of a specific account.
4. **Account Modification**: Update or delete account information.
5. **Persistent Storage**: Data is saved in a file to persist between sessions.

The system ensures that user data is maintained in a file and can be accessed or modified during runtime.

## Technologies Used

- **C++**: The core programming language for building the application.
- **File Handling**: Used for storing account information and transaction details persistently.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Bank Management System, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   git clone https://github.com/syedahmershah/bank-management-system.git

2. **Compile the code using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++)**:
g++ main.cpp -o bank_management


3. **Run the program:
./bank_management


## Example Usage

When prompted, choose an option (e.g., Create Account, Deposit, Withdraw).
- Follow the on-screen instructions to input account details and perform transactions.
